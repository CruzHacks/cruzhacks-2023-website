            CruzHacks is an event where people can collaborate, network, and
            wield technology to solve problems. Each year, we welcome hundreds
            of college and high school students interested in developing
            technology for social good. We strive to empower the next generation
            of creators by providing the tools, environment, and motivation to
            plausibly solve real-world problems. Our initiative is to expand
            diversity in tech by sparking the drive to innovate within all our
            participants.

      <div className='about__container--history'>
        CruzHacks was founded in 2013 as Hack UCSC by Mark Adams, Brent Haddad,
        and Doug Erickson. In 2018, Hack UCSC was rebranded as CruzHacks, and
        became a student-led non-profit hackathon. Throughout the years,
        CruzHacks/Hack UCSC has sparked innovation and creativity from
        attendees, and has even been the source of a few start-up companies.

        When the pandemic struck in 2020, we saw it as an opportunity to bring
        our event online and expand accessibility - and we did! We saw
        participants from over 90 countries engage in our events. But after 2
        years of holding a virtual hackathon, weâ€™re excited to return to our
        roots in 2023 for our first in-person event since 2020.
